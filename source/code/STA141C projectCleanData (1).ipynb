    "Then, we create our own list of stopwords and combined it with the stopwords list from nltk.corpus, but we choose to keep interrogative words. Because for example, if we have two questions: \"Where is the book?\" and \"How is the book?\", these are two completely different questions, then if we remove interrogative words, there is no way to distinguish them. We also discovered that many interrogative words are in contraction format, so in order to keep them, we found a dictionary and use it to spread out the contraction form and thus keep them not been removed by stopword list. \n",

    "Next, we create a function to clean the text and only keep important words. We first put words in to lower case and  remove certain symbols and punctuations and replace it with space, then we remove extra space. We also need to deal with negation problem, because we have dealt with contraction words, so we just need to concadinate \"not\" with next word so that it won't be removed by stopwords. Then we split the string into words and stem each words and remove stopwords, at last it returns a list of words for each questionm.\n"
